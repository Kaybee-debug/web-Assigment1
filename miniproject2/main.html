    <h1>Welcome to my Home</h1>
    <p>Home is where the heart is’ — is a popular proverb and home in a village <br>
        is more comfortable than a town. My home is in a village and it is made <br>
        of brick, wood, and tin. Such kind of home is popularly known as half building. <br>
        There are five members in my family. They are parents, aunts, me, and my younger <br>
        sister, Ankhi. As a proud member of my family, I can say that my home is comfortable.</p> 

       <p>Here everybody has a separate <a href="./restRoom.html"> rest room</a>  ,I have a separate <a href="./studyRoom.html">study room</a>  also and we share <a href="./kitchen.html">Kitchen</a> <br>
       I like my house very much because it meets every need of its members.<br>
       I am thankful for my home because when I grow up, I can look back at the <br>
       wonderful memories I made here. The walk down the memory lane will be a sweet <br>
       one because of the safety and security my home has given me. It is indeed an ideal home.
