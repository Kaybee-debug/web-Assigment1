        The woman who have been submissive to her in laws and love<br>
        her husband through all the challenges they came across in life<br>
        His husband passsed away and believe it was so painful not to mention that <br>
        he was the bread winner but yet again with the grace of Lord we <br>
        survived and she find a way to keep her family together everytime.<br>
